        This is an experimental command to help with automated integration
        testing of shared modules. The usage and behavior of this command is
        likely to change in breaking ways in subsequent releases, as we
        are currently using this command primarily for research purposes.

        In its current experimental form, "test" will look under the current
        working directory for a subdirectory called "tests", and then within
        that directory search for one or more subdirectories that contain
        ".tf" or ".tf.json" files. For any that it finds, it will perform
        Terraform operations similar to the following sequence of commands
        in each of those directories:
          terraform validate
          terraform apply
          terraform destroy

        The test configurations should not declare any input variables and
        should at least contain a call to the module being tested, which
        will always be available at the path ../.. due to the expected
        filesystem layout.

        The tests are considered to be successful if all of the above steps
        succeed.

        Test configurations may optionally include uses of the special
        built-in test provider terraform.io/builtin/test, which allows
        writing explicit test assertions which must also all pass in order
        for the test run to be considered successful.

        This initial implementation is intended as a minimally-viable
        product to use for further research and experimentation, and in
        particular it currently lacks the following capabilities that we
        expect to consider in later iterations, based on feedback:
            - Testing of subsequent updates to existing infrastructure,
              where currently it only supports initial creation and
              then destruction.
            - Testing top-level modules that are intended to be used for
              "real" environments, which typically have hard-coded values
              that don't permit creating a separate "copy" for testing.
            - Some sort of support for unit test runs that don't interact
              with remote systems at all, e.g. for use in checking pull
              requests from untrusted contributors.

        In the meantime, we'd like to hear feedback from module authors
        who have tried writing some experimental tests for their modules
        about what sorts of tests you were able to write, what sorts of
        tests you weren't able to write, and any tests that you were

            This format is commonly supported by CI systems, and they typically
